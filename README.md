# Multi-task-fcn

## Overview

Multi-task-fcn is a collaborative project with Professor Dario Oliveira from FGV (Getúlio Vargas Foundation), aimed at addressing the crucial challenge of semantic segmentation for identifying tree species within vast and densely forested areas. The project's primary objective is to create a scalable model for monitoring deforestation and, more specifically, selective deforestation, which often remains imperceptible to the human eye.

## Project Status

The project is currently focused on semantic segmentation of tree crowns within the 
Municipality of Curitibano, Santa Catarina, Brazil. We are utilizing high-quality 
images obtained from remote sensing to conduct initial tests of our model. 
These images capture a static point in time, providing a foundation for our research.

## Future Goals

Our next major goal is to extend our efforts into the realm of time series analysis. 
We aim to implement our segmentation model on a series of lower-quality remote sensing 
images. This expansion will enable us to track changes in the forest canopy over time, 
enhancing our ability to monitor deforestation and selective deforestation more effectively.

## Problem Statement

Deforestation poses a significant threat to our environment, biodiversity, and the global 
ecosystem. However, identifying and tracking deforestation, especially when it involves 
selectively removing specific tree species, is a complex and resource-intensive task. 
Traditional monitoring methods are often unable to capture subtle changes in dense forest 
regions, making it imperative to develop advanced computer vision and machine learning 
solutions.

## Project Goals

Our project, Multi-task-fcn, aims to:

- Develop a robust semantic segmentation model capable of identifying tree species within vast and dense forest areas.
- Enable precise monitoring of deforestation, including selective deforestation, which is difficult to detect visually.
- Create a scalable solution that can be applied to a variety of geographical locations and forest types.

## How It Works

We are utilizing state-of-the-art techniques in deep learning, particularly the Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) architecture, 
to achieve precise semantic segmentation of tree species. Our model leverages multi-task learning to improve overall accuracy
and to detect changes that may indicate deforestation.
