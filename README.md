# Multi-task-fcn

## Overview

Multi-task-fcn is a collaborative project with Professor Dario Oliveira and Researcher [Your Name] from FGV (Get√∫lio Vargas Foundation), aimed at addressing the crucial challenge of semantic segmentation for identifying tree species within vast and densely forested areas. The project's primary objective is to create a scalable model for monitoring deforestation and, more specifically, selective deforestation, which often remains imperceptible to the human eye.

## Project Status

The project is currently focused on semantic segmentation of tree crowns within the 
Municipality of Curitibano, Santa Catarina, Brazil. We are utilizing high-quality 
images obtained from remote sensing to conduct initial tests of our model. 
These images capture a static point in time, providing a foundation for our research.

## Future Goals

Our next major goal is to extend our efforts into the realm of time series analysis. 
We aim to implement our segmentation model on a series of lower-quality remote sensing 
images. This expansion will enable us to track changes in the forest canopy over time, 
enhancing our ability to monitor deforestation and selective deforestation more effectively.

## Problem Statement

Deforestation poses a significant threat to our environment, biodiversity, and the global 
ecosystem. However, identifying and tracking deforestation, especially when it involves 
selectively removing specific tree species, is a complex and resource-intensive task. 
Traditional monitoring methods are often unable to capture subtle changes in dense forest 
regions, making it imperative to develop advanced computer vision and machine learning 
solutions.

## Project Goals

Our project, Multi-task-fcn, aims to:

- Develop a robust semantic segmentation model capable of identifying tree species within vast and dense forest areas.
- Enable precise monitoring of deforestation, including selective deforestation, which is difficult to detect visually.
- Create a scalable solution that can be applied to a variety of geographical locations and forest types.

## How It Works

We are utilizing state-of-the-art techniques in deep learning, particularly the Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) architecture, 
to achieve precise semantic segmentation of tree species. Our model leverages multi-task learning to improve overall accuracy
and to detect changes that may indicate deforestation.
